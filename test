      <h2>More about Naruto</h2>

      <p>
        The story is in two parts, the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and
        the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by
        Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention
        in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto
        (1997). Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shonen Jump
        from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankobon (book) form in 72 volumes.
        The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by
        Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to
        2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on Cartoon Network and
        YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original
        series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500
        episodes. The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to
        2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult
        Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the
        first episode. The English adaptation is still airing weekly on Adult
        Swim to this day. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven
        movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related
        merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards
        developed by several companies. Viz Media licensed the manga and anime
        for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital
        Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United
        States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in
        2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series
        were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie
        theaters. Viz Media began streaming the two anime series on their
        streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012. The story of Naruto
        continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next
        Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of
        following his father's. Naruto is the fourth best-selling manga series
        in history, selling 250 million copies worldwide in 46 countries.It has
        become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English
        translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York
        Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill
        Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development,
        strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the
        fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which
        has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from
        Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

      <h1><u> Plot </u></h1>
      <h2><strong> Part 1</strong></h2>

      <p>
        A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf
        village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in
        the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha, the Fourth Hokage,
        seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making
        Naruto a host of the beast; this costs Naruto's father his life, and the
        Third Hokage returns from retirement to become leader of Konoha again.
        Naruto is often ridiculed by the Konoha villagers for being the host of
        the Nine-Tails. Because of a decree made by the Third Hokage forbidding
        anyone to mention these events, Naruto knows nothing about the
        Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals
        the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the
        respect of his teacher Iruka Umino.<br />

        Shortly afterwards, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha,
        against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a
        crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja
        Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7
        completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores
        and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.<br />

        After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves,
        Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to
        a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin
        Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha
        and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three
        legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with
        Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.
        <br />

        During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke
        because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan. After Sasuke
        attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi when he showed up in
        Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him
        the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke
        leaves the Konoha village and when Tsunade finds out, she sends a group
        of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to
        persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on
        Sasuke: Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare
        himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes
        Tsunade's apprentice. <br />
      </p>

      <h2><strong> Part 2 </strong></h2>

      <p>
        Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with
        Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed
        Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for
        their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting
        seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is
        now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi
        to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the
        Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi received an order from Konoha's
        superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup. He accepted it on the
        condition that he would be allowed to spare Sasuke. Saddened by this
        revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As
        Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead
        leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats
        and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration. <br />

        With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's
        founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed
        Beasts to perform an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity
        and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse
        to help him and instead join forces to confront Tobi and his allies.
        That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined
        armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces)
        and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep
        Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure
        (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island
        with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto along
        with the help of Killer Bee gains control of his Tailed Beast and the
        two of them head for the battlefield. <br />

        During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former
        teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved
        Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the
        history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's
        downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and
        Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends
        up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to
        subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7
        stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes
        advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts,
        as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto
        confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost
        kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms.
        After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for
        his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata
        Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.

      <h1><u> Production </u></h1>

      <h2><strong>Development </strong></h2>

      <p>
        In 1995, Shueisha released Karakuri, a one-shot manga by Masashi
        Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the Hop Step Award in
        1996. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow
        up, and decided to work on another project. The new project was
        originally going to feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never
        made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who
        could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the
        summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump based on the idea. Despite the
        positive feedback it received in a readers' poll, Kishimoto was unhappy
        with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.
        <br />

        The first eight chapters of Naruto were planned before it appeared in
        Weekly Shonen Jump, and these chapters originally devoted many panels of
        intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time Naruto
        debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the
        characters. Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra (the energy source
        used by the ninjas in Naruto) made the series too Japanese, he still
        believed it is an enjoyable read. Kishimoto is a fan of Godzilla, and
        the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an
        excuse to draw monsters.He has said that the central theme in Part I of
        Naruto is how people accept each other, citing Naruto's development
        across the series as an example. <br />

        For Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and
        the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid "overdoing the typical
        manga style".He considers that his drawing style has changed from "the
        classic manga look to something a bit more realistic." Because of
        wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha search for his brother,
        Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should
        include more chapters than regular volumes. As a result, Kishimoto
        apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than
        regular volumes.
      </p>

      <h2><strong> Characters </strong></h2>

      <p>
        When he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other shonen manga as
        influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while
        basing the story on Japanese culture.The separation of the characters
        into different teams was intended to give each group a particular
        flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in
        one skill and be talentless in another. He found it difficult to write
        about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning
        with volume 28. He introduced villains into the story to have them act
        as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate
        their differences. As a result of how the younger characters were
        significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in
        order to have them age and become stronger during this time.
      </p>

      <h2><strong> Setting </strong></h2>

      <p>
        Kishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition, which had a
        long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from
        this. When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto
        manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of
        Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him "pretty spontaneously
        without much thought", but admits that the scenery became based on his
        home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama prefecture. Since the
        storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern
        elements in the series such as convenience stores. He considered
        including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded
        projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot.
      </p>

      <h2><strong> Conclusion </strong></h2>

      <p>
        When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a
        fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke, That villain Nagato,
        also known as Pain, and the arc that was the important according to
        Kishimoto was the Pain Invasion Arc. This arc paved the way for the
        ending of Naruto to occur. Having Naruto fight a villain that he could
        not answer to about war until Naruto has experienced it for himself was
        the only way to go. And so, Nagato or Pain had Naruto experience having
        lost his mentor Jiraiya and being unable to forgive an enemy as Naruto
        always has done in the past. It was a developing point for Naruto as he
        finally could not answer something he had never experienced, and that
        was war. Kishimoto knew from then on that he would have to create the
        Fourth Great Shinobi War so Naruto could experience it and end the
        series after the end of the war. <br />

        These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato.
        Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from the early
        stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired
        Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant
        the two of them could build a relationship. This decision annoyed his
        wife because she wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno,but Kishimoto
        viewed Sakura as Naruto's friend and teammate, rather than a future
        wife. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of forming a love
        triangle among the three characters, but because he decided that
        fighting was the main focus of the manga, there was little room for
        romantic plotlines.By August 2009, Kishimoto had already planned the
        series' following chapters and how it would conclude, stating he had yet
        needed the energy to finish the series. This caused concerns within
        readers who feared the manga would end shortly after Naruto and Nagato's
        confrontation. However, Kishimoto clarified shortly afterwards that the
        length would be bigger.

        former assistant Mikio Ikemoto and writer Ukyo Kodachi write Boruto:
        Naruto Next Generations as the sequel to Naruto.
